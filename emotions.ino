  Optimistic Plant
  (Conveying an emotion: optimism)
  Optimism reminds me of a glass half-full. And what else loves a half glass of water?
  That's right, plants do. While it would be interesting to have the plant react to
  data or world news, for now it's just happy to see you. Being in good company makes
  the future look brighter!

  Uses an Ultrasonic sensor, a stepper motor and a LED
